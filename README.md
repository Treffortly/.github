📌 Detailed Use‑Case Explanations

AI Assistant (LLM Chat) – Handles free‑form chat, converts natural sentences like “remind me to prep slides before Friday” into a structured task with deadline & XP. Also surfaces weekly coaching tips derived from analytics.

Smart Tagging (Zero‑Shot Classifier) – On task creation or import, the classifier infers domain‑specific tags. This feeds color coding + filtering, and improves the analytics pipeline without any manual taxonomy upkeep.

Daily Brief (Summarizer) – Every morning the summarizer queries yesterday’s completed tasks, leaderboard shifts, and chat highlights, then crafts a 200‑word digest pushed to Notifications and optional email.

Localization (Translation) – All user‑generated text (tasks, comments) passes through SeamlessM4T on‑the‑fly when teammates have different locale settings, ensuring mixed‑language teams stay productive.

Conversational BI (Table‑QA) – Inside Analytics, users type “XP by category last month” → TAPEX reads the aggregated Postgres view and returns a chart + narrative answer.

Voice Capture (Whisper‑v3) – Mobile PWA records offline audio, transcribes locally, syncs when online; ideal for quick entries while commuting or in meetings.

Ambient Coach (TTS) – During Focus Mode the app whispers the next task, reads streak status, and encourages breaks—accessible UX for neuro‑diverse users.

Visual Task Ingestion (BLIP‑2) – Upload a photo of a sticky‑note board; detected text nodes are batch‑imported as tasks with suggested due dates heuristically inferred.

XR Gamification (SAM + MiDas) – Spatial‑computing mode for emerging Android‑based glasses (XReal, Rokid, Lenovo). Places 3‑D XP orbs or progress bars in your physical environment; completing tasks grows the orb in real‑time with occlusion‑aware rendering driven by depth maps.

Social Graph (Graphormer) – Weekly job recommends pairing you with colleagues who have complementary productivity patterns, boosting accountability.

Productivity Foresight (Time‑Series) – Monitors streak length, task backlog growth, and session times to predict fatigue two days ahead, nudging users to re‑balance.

Adaptive XP Economy (RL Agent) – Reward multipliers evolve with engagement telemetry, preventing XP inflation while keeping dopamine curves optimally tuned.

These rich, independent yet interoperable AI services position Treffortly as a cutting‑edge, portfolio‑worthy product, demonstrating not only integration skills but also thoughtful product design that converts ML capability into concrete user value.

📐 XR Runtime Technical Notes

Layer

Recommended Tooling

Why & How

Abstraction

WebXR + OpenXR Bridge

Web‑standard API runs in Chrome for Android‑XR browsers; bridge to native via OpenXR for XReal / Rokid when launching as progressive web‑app.

3‑D Engine

React Three Fiber (Three.js)

Maintains React dev flow; works with Next.js 15 RSC + <Suspense> for lazy‑loading GLB assets; shader injection for depth‑based occlusion.

Depth & Occlusion

WebXR Depth‑Sensing API (Pixel, Lenovo) → fallback to MiDas depth inference

Ensures virtual XP orbs hide behind real objects; MiDas runs on‑device when hardware depth not available.

Device SDKs

XReal Nebula WebXR, Rokid AR SDK, ARCore XR Runtime

Gives access to hand‑tracking, controller rays, plane detection; feature‑detect and polyfill where absent.

Build & Deploy

Vite + vite-plugin-webxr (dev) / Vercel Edge CDN (prod)

Fast HMR for XR scenes; GLB + texture assets served from nearest edge to reduce motion‑to‑photon latency.

Performance Targets

Foveated rendering (preferredFramebufferScaleFactor), 60 fps, <10 ms motion latency

Dynamically lower mesh resolution outside 5° fovea; use requestAnimationFrame loop tied to XR session.

Interaction Model

Gaze + Air‑Tap (headset), Pointer & Touch (mobile AR)

Unified via @react-three/xr; same component handles pointer enter/leave & select events across devices.

Stretch Goal: adopt upcoming OpenXR hand‑mesh extension—map user XP level to a glowing aura around their hand skeleton, providing instant, embodied feedback.
